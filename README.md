### Trying DApp Wallet with React & ethers.js

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to interact with Ethereum-based tokens using React and ethers.js. The wallet includes features like token watchlists, historical data retrieval via Etherscan, token transfers, and more.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tryDapp.git
   cd tryDapp/client
   ```

2. **Set up Etherscan API Key:**
   - Get your Etherscan API key.
   - Replace the placeholder API key with your own in `src/components/HistoricalData.jsx` (line 15).

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## **Hosting**
   - The DApp is hosted, and you can view it live at [Insert hosted link here].

## **Some Notes**

- The `server/` folder is currently empty, as no backend functionality has been implemented yet.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
- Various frameworks and libraries are included; check the `package.json` file for details.
  
### **Completed Components:**
  - `WatchList.jsx`: Manage and display a list of tokens.
  - `HistoricalData.jsx`: Fetch and display historical token data using the Etherscan API.
  - `TokenTransfer.jsx`: Handle token transfers between wallets.

### **Incomplete Components:**
  - `TokenAllowance.jsx`: This component is a work in progress for handling token allowances.

## **Project Structure**

```bash
src/
  components/
    Home.jsx               # Default route with wallet connection logic
    WatchList.jsx           # Manage token watchlist
    HistoricalData.jsx      # Fetch and display historical token data
    TokenTransfer.jsx       # Handle token transfers
    TokenAllowance.jsx      # (Incomplete) Manage token allowances
    Navbar.jsx              # Navigation bar component
    Layout.jsx              # Layout component (Navbar + content)
  contexts/
    WalletContext.js        # Wallet context for handling provider and wallet states
  App.jsx                   # Route definitions
  index.jsx                 # ReactDOM rendering entry point
```

### **Routing and Layout:**
- **Defined Routes:** All routes are defined in `App.jsx`.
- **Layout Component:** The layout structure includes a Navbar and dynamic content (`children`) to ensure a consistent design across all pages.
- **Default Route:** The default route is set to `Home.jsx`, where wallet connection logic is handled.

## **APIs**
- **Etherscan API:** Used to fetch historical token data in `HistoricalData.jsx`.
